# Conway's Game of Life - C++ Implementation

This is my implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton, written in C++. The program simulates the evolution of a grid of cells based on a set of rules.

## Features
- Configurable grid size
- Command-line interface
- Supports different initial configurations (gliders, blinkers, etc.)
- Continuous evolution
- Сell color variable
- Сounting generations and number of cells
- Variable rate of evolution
